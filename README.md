# CustomSheet

CustomSheet is a demo application that showcases how to implement a custom sheet effect in SwiftUI.

## Description

CustomSheet uses SwiftUI to create a view that simulates the behavior of a custom sheet that scrolls up and down in response to user gestures.
The sheet consists of two parts: a top part and a bottom part, which dynamically adjust based on user interaction.

## Features

- Scroll the sheet up and down using swipe gestures.
- Automatically adjust the sheet's height based on user interaction.
- Bounce animation when reaching the sheet's boundaries.
- Automatic scrolling of the sheet with animations.

## Usage

To try out the application, simply run the project in Xcode.
You can scroll the sheet using swipe gestures and observe how it dynamically adjusts in response to your interaction.
